# Measure-Distance-Using-LCD-and-Ultrasonic-Sensor

This is a simple distance measuring device. This uses Ultrasonic Sensor to calculate the distance and displays it on a 16x2 LCD.

Ultrasonic sensors work by emitting sound waves at a frequency too high for humans to hear. They then wait for the sound to be reflected back, calculating distance based on the time required. This is similar to how radar measures the time it takes a radio wave to return after hitting an object.

The potentiometer is used to accommodate the desires of the user in terms of screen brightness or screen contrast. Simply put, it controls the backlight of the Liquid Crystal Display.
